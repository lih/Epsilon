Epsilon : A syntax editor
-------------------------

In the beginning, the programming art were carried out using only a
small number of tools : a text editor to view and modify the code; and
a compiler to translate it. A lot of progress has been made in the
field of compilers and languages since then, but text editors are
pretty much the same nowadays as they were then.

Enter syntax editing !

Syntax editing is like text editing, except that you may only navigate
within and modify the structure of your code, while Epsilon makes it 
look good. No more whitespace wars, no more counting parens, no more 
syntax errors...

...just you and your code...
